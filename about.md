<p>Hello! My name is Taylor. I'm currently a university student studying about cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Currently, my main focus lies within the areas of penetration testing, red teaming, and payload 
development. I also have experience in computer networking, security engineering, and cloud technologies.</p>

<p>This page will contain blog posts on my learning experiences, both technical and personal. I hope that 
you take something away from my posts!</p>
