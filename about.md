Hello! My name is Taylor. I'm currently working as an Associated Red Team Consultant at CrowdStrike.

I studied at Cal Poly Pomona from 2019 to 2023, where I was part of a club called [SWIFT](https://www.calpolyswift.org/) and also competed in CCDC and CPTC through [CPP Cyber](https://cysec.team/).

Currently, my main focus lies within offensive security. I've also worked in computer networking, security engineering, and cloud technologies.

This page will contain blog posts on my technical and personal learning experiences. I hope that you take something away from my posts!
