Many blogs and write-ups describe DMARC as an additional security measure that builds upon SPF and DKIM for anti-spoofing and prevent phishing, and then attempt to pitch their own DMARC analyzer tool to provide "advanced malware protection" against attackers.

Yes I'm looking at you, Mimecast.

The goal here is to provide a technical overview of how SPF, DKIM, and DMARC work without having to deal with the BS of vendors forcing their product into your faces.

# DMARC in a nutshell

DMARC stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance. DMARC uses SPF and DKIM to perform validation on incoming email messages.

We'll talk more about how DMARC works in more detail, but essentially it performs an action based on the outputs of DKIM and SPF checks for incoming emails.

DMARC records can be found in a TXT record for the `_dmarc` subdomain of a given domain. For example, if I wanted to get the DMARC record for `steampowered.com`, I would query for a TXT record at `_dmarc.steampowered.com`:

```
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:e8b9a9244a5c591@rep.dmarcanalyzer.com; ruf=mailto:e8b9a9244a5c591@for.dmarcanalyzer.com; pct=100; sp=reject; fo=1;
```

- `v=DMARC1` - included in every DMARC record
- `p=reject` - the DMARC policy (in this case, reject the email)
- `rua=mailto:` - the email to send aggregate (summary) reports of DMARC checks.
- `ruf=mailto:` - the email to send forensic (detailed) reports of DMARC checks
- `pct=100` - the percentage of emails to go through a DMARC check
- `sp=reject` - the DMARC policy for subdomains (in this case, reject)
- `fo=1` - generate a report to the RUA whenever either SPF or DKIM do not produce an "aligned pass" result. (We'll go over this later too)

# What is SPF?

SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework. It lays out the guidelines on who is allowed to send email from a specific domain. You can think of it like an access control list for email messages.

SPF is configured in the form of a TXT record of a given domain. Here's what the SPF record looks like for `steampowered.com`:

```
v=spf1 mx ip4:72.165.61.134/31 ip4:208.64.202.32/27 -all
```

- `v=spf1` - included in every SPF record
- `mx` - refers to the IP address of sender is associated with the MX record of the domain.
- `ip4:72.165.61.134/31` - refers to the IP range of `72.165.61.134/31`
- `ip4:208.64.202.32/27` - refers to the IP range of `208.64.202.32/27`
- `-all` - allows emails to be delivered if the sender IP address matches any of the IP addresses listed in the record, and rejects emails sent from non-listed IP addresses.

Each of the items in the SPF record are called "mechanisms". So you would refer to `mx` as the `mx` mechanism, `ip4` as the `ip4` mechanism, and so on. In general, they're referred to as "tags" but in SPF they're specifically "mechanisms".


You may see `~all` or `+all` or `?all` in other SPF records. The character behind the `all` are referred to as qualifiers or prefixes. Here's what they mean:
- `-all` - also known as a **hardfail**, emails that don't match the allowed IP addresses are rejected.
- `~all` - also known as a **softfail**, emails that don't match the allowed IP addresses are still delivered but are marked with an SPF fail check
- `+all` - emails that don't match the allowed IP addresses still get delivered anyways.
- `?all` - don't perform SPF verification at all and deliver the email anyways.

This is how SPF works in a nutshell:
1. An email server receives an incoming email message.
2. The email server looks at the domain of the `Return-Path` header of the email message.
3. The email server retrieves the SPF record of the `Return-Path` domain.
4. If the source IP of the email message matches the IP addresses specified within the SPF record, then the email message is said to be **SPF authenticated**.
5. The email server will then decide how to deliver the email based on the SPF record's `all` mechanism.

# What is DKIM?

DKIM stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail. It ensures that the sender of an email address is who they actually are, as well as that the email message has not been modified in transit.

DKIM uses digital signatures and asymmetric key encryption to achieve this. Emails are sent with a DKIM signature, which contains encrypted hashes of some of the email headers and the body of the message. The specific email headers chosen to be included in the DKIM signature are configured at the email server.

This is the DKIM record associated with `steampowered.com`:

```
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDESbiiHOv8WD5RPZ8UAYkS+rmxWyWV7l+g5jtfkZEKsOokamC9RnRHBlZiKucmA1o0ffmg+Z8KAFjf4Yy9OL1OGEO20F3UfMACffbJNsun67J3V7XWBsJwczEsJ21rmAhF0c9ntyg6yGAxwiYfzONhi0WKuN1QLslFjBRcMLoIrQIDAQAB
```

- `v=DKIM1` - included in every DKIM record
- `k=rsa` - the type of key being used in the `p` field
- `p=MIGf...` - the DKIM public key used to decrypt digital signatures

In order to query the DKIM record, you would need to know the **selector** that is being used. The `selector` is a value that is included in the DKIM signature to specify the location of the DKIM record.

Therefore, the DKIM record would be located at `[selector]._domainkey.<domain>`. 

The `selector` can be any arbitrary string of text. For example, if I want my `selector` to be `deeznuts` then my DKIM TXT record will be located at `deeznuts._domainkey.tsnguyen.com`. The sending email server then must be configured to use `deeznuts` as the `selector` of the DKIM signature.

This is how DKIM works in a nutshell:
1. The sending email server computes the hashes of email headers and body.
2. The sending email server encrypts the hash with a DKIM private key.
3. Sending email server includes the encrypted hash into a DKIM signature, along with other information such as the hashing algorithm used and the domain and selector to use to query DKIM records.
4. Email is sent to client, along with the DKIM signature (that contains the encrypted hash).
5. The client email server sees the DKIM signature and obtains the DKIM public key from querying the DKIM record.
6. The client email server decrypts the hash from DKIM signature using the DKIM public key.
7. The client email server generates its own hash of the email headers and body.
8. If the hashes are the same, the client email server verifies that the email and sender are valid, and the email is said to be **DKIM authenticated**.

## Extra DKIM notes

**DKIM signers** usually refer to the systems within the email chain that are responsible for performing the hashing and encrypting of email messages, while **DKIM verifiers** usually refer to the systems on the receiving end of the email message that decrypt and compare the hashes. They are  used more often describe the DKIM process rather than describing individual entities. 

# DMARC Alignment

We've talked about how email messages can be **SPF** and **DKIM** **authenticated**. But DMARC throws in another term called **alignment**, which is super important because alignment determines 

According to RFC 7489, an **authenticated identifier** is a domain that has been validated using either SPF or DKIM. That would be the `Return-Path` value for SPF and the `d=` value for DKIM.

DMARC identifier alignment occurs when the domain authenticated by SPF and/or DKIM matches the `From:` header of the email message.

Why "and/or"? Because DMARC only requires **one** of the two authentication mechanisms to pass and align with the sending domain. 

That means if SPF passes but DKIM fails, as long as the domain used by SPF matches with the domain in the `From:` field, then DMARC passes as well. Now if SPF and DKIM both pass but DMARC fails, then that means that the domain in the `From:` field may not match either of the domains evaluated by SPF and DKIM.

<b>In other words, DMARC checks are validated when:
- <b>The domain passes authentication - the message passes at least one authentication method, being SPF or DKIM
- <b>The domain passes alignment - the domain authenticated from SPF and/or DKIM matches the domain in the `From:` field of the message

# Example of SPF and DKIM passing but DMARC failing

Let's look at the following email message:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/images/dmarc/headers-1.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

It seems that SPF and DKIM both pass but DMARC fails. Let's take a closer look at the email headers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/images/dmarc/headers-2.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

SPF uses the domain of the `Return-Path` header to perform the SPF check. If we look at the `Return-Path` of this email message, we can see that it is `amazonses.com`. Similarly, if we look at the domain used to validate DKIM, it is also `amazonses.com`, listed as the `d=` field in the `DKIM-Signature` header.

However, our `From` address is a `gmail.com` domain. Because `gmail.com` is different then the SPF- and DKIM-validated domain of `amazonses.com`, DMARC authentication fails.
